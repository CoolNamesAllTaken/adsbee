# Enforce the firmware/AGENTS.md rule: a change to a product's Settings struct (kSettingsVersion)
# must be accompanied by a firmware version bump for that product. Otherwise the device won't
# detect a version mismatch and won't reflash coprocessors, leaving them on a stale build with a
# mismatched Settings struct (SPI sync failures, reboots).
#
# Checked per product:
#   adsbee_1090: versions live in firmware/common (settings.hh kSettingsVersion,
#                coprocessor/object_dictionary.cpp kFirmwareVersion*); watched paths are the
#                ESP32/CC1312 coprocessor code and shared common/ code.
#   adsbee_1421: versions live in firmware/adsbee_1421/ti (settings/settings.hh,
#                object_dictionary/object_dictionary.cpp); watched paths are the whole product
#                directory and shared common/ code.
# Note: a firmware/common change therefore requires a version bump in BOTH products.
#
# Compares the coupled version numbers between an "old" and a "new" source and fails if the
# settings version changed without a matching firmware version bump, or if watched firmware
# paths changed without a firmware version bump.
#
# Usage: check_version_sync.sh <old_source> <new_source>
#   Each source is one of:
#     WORKTREE   - the current files on disk (unstaged + staged changes)
#     INDEX      - the staged (about-to-be-committed) content
#     <git-ref>  - any git revision, e.g. HEAD, origin/main, a commit SHA
#
#   Examples:
#     check_version_sync.sh HEAD WORKTREE      # local build: committed vs working tree
#     check_version_sync.sh HEAD INDEX         # pre-commit hook: committed vs staged
#     check_version_sync.sh origin/main HEAD   # CI: base branch vs PR head
