# CC1312 Directory

This directory contains files used by the RP2040 to interact with the CC1312. Note that code which actually runs on the CC1312 itself is in the `firmware/ti` directory, where the CC1312 code is compiled.

## Directories
* `bin` - CC1312 binary image is copied here, to be linked into the RP2040 firmware image at compile time.
* `smartrf` - Files generated by SmartRF Studio during device evaluation are placed here. These files are not used for compilation.
