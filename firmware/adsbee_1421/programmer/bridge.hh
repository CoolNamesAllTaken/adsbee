// Transparent USB-CDC <-> UART pass-through emulating a TTL USB-UART adapter wired the way the
// existing host tools expect (see software/adsbee_1421_flasher/README.md):
//
//   host RTS bit asserted  -> SYNC pin LOW   (asserting a modem-control line drives the physical
//   host RTS bit deasserted-> SYNC pin HIGH   pin low on FTDI-style adapters; the web console and
//   host DTR bit asserted  -> RESET_N pulse   python flasher are written against that polarity)
//
// DTR is edge-triggered (a 50 ms reset pulse on assert) rather than level-held so terminals that
// keep DTR asserted for the whole session do not hold the device in reset. Host line-coding baud
// changes are applied to the UART directly.
