/**
 * 1090MHz receiver: conversions from the RF power detector voltage (AD8313 behind two LNAs, read on the RSSI ADC input
 * through a 10k / 1nF low pass) to dBm at the antenna connector.
 *
 * The low pass (10us) averages the detector's log output over the pulses of a Mode S packet, so a packet sample sits
 * only a fraction of the pulse height above the noise floor. Static levels (noise floor, trigger level) are not
 * affected. The packet sample is taken as the packet ends: it has settled by then, so it reads the same for 56 and
 * 112 bit packets.
 *
 * One calibration serves every RF front end version: the detector, its low pass and the ADC path are the same on all
 * of them (the versions differ in the comparator network). It was measured with CW and Mode S packets on a 1090U
 * rev G (2026-10). Gain differences between boards and SAW filter types shift the reading by the same amount.
