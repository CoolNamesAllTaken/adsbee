/**
 * Generic, receiver-agnostic NMEA 0183 parser.
 *
 * Designed to be tolerant of NMEA protocol version differences (2.x through 4.11) so the same
 * parsing core works across a wide range of GNSS receivers:
 *   - Matches on the 3-character sentence type (e.g. "GGA", "RMC"), ignoring the 2-character
 *     talker ID, so multi-constellation talkers ($GPGGA, $GNGGA, $GLGGA, $GAGGA, ...) all parse.
 *   - Indexes fields positionally from the front and tolerates extra trailing fields appended by
 *     newer versions (e.g. RMC navigational status in v2.3+, system/signal IDs in v4.11).
 *   - Treats empty fields as "not present" rather than faulting.
 *   - Validates the XOR checksum when present.
 *
 * The parser has no platform dependencies (no pico-sdk) so it can be unit tested on the host.
 *
 * Usage: feed received UART bytes one at a time to IngestByte(). When a complete, valid sentence
 * is decoded the internally held GNSSFix is updated; query it via fix().
