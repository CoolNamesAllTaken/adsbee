/**
 * RemoteIDManager orchestrates Broadcast Remote ID (ASTM F3411) reception on the ESP32-S3.
 *
 * It decides which transports can actually run given (a) the user's settings, (b) the hardware build (PSRAM lets Remote
 * ID coexist with WiFi AP/STA; without PSRAM, RAM only allows Remote ID when WiFi is off and Ethernet carries IP), and
 * (c) live heap headroom. It brings up the BLE (NimBLE) observer and, on capable configurations, the WiFi promiscuous
 * sniffer; both feed a single de-duplication / rate-limiting stage before packets are ingested locally and forwarded to
 * the RP2040.
 *
 * Wiring:
 *   - Received advertisements are parsed to raw ODID bytes and handed to OnRawRemoteIDPacket() (from the NimBLE host
 *     task or the WiFi promiscuous callback).
 *   - OnRawRemoteIDPacket() always ingests into the ESP32's local AircraftDictionary (drives network output) and, after
 *     rate-limiting, enqueues a copy into the out-queue (GetOutQueue()) for the RP2040 to pull.
 *
 * Buffers: the ingest and out queues are allocated lazily (heap) only once a transport actually starts, so a build
 * where Remote ID is disabled or Bluetooth isn't compiled in pays zero internal SRAM for them. They are not freed at
 * runtime: the out-queue is read from the SPI task (ObjectDictionary::GetBytes) while the main task services it, so
 * freeing them on disable would race those consumers; the RAM stays claimed only after Remote ID is enabled at least
 * once (rare), which is an acceptable trade for avoiding a use-after-free.
 *   - Apply() is called from SettingsManager::Apply() (esp/main/settings.cpp) after the WiFi/Ethernet interfaces are
 *     (re)configured, so it sees the resolved network state.
 *   - GetStatus() feeds ObjectDictionary::ESP32DeviceStatus::remote_id_status so the RP2040 can explain the live state.
