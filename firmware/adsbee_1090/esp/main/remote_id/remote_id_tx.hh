/**
 * Builds the Open Drone ID (ASTM F3411) messages that the ADSBee transmits when it acts as a Broadcast Remote ID
 * transmitter, either as a bench test transmitter for checking Remote ID receiver performance, or mounted on a drone
 * as a combined ADS-B receiver / Remote ID transmitter.
 *
 * This class owns only the *content* of what is transmitted; the radios are driven by RemoteIDManager
 * (remote_id_ble.cpp advertises the bytes over BLE, remote_id_wifi_tx.cpp injects them in a WiFi beacon).
 *
 * Message content is assembled from:
 *   - The UA (drone) position: ObjectDictionary::CompositeDeviceStatus::rp2040.rx_position, which the RP2040 pushes at
 *     1 Hz. That is a fixed coordinate for a bench transmitter (AT+RX_POSITION) or a live position on a drone. When no
 *     position is available the Location message is still transmitted, with ODID "unknown" sentinels, so receivers can
 *     still see and identify the transmitter.
 *   - Identity settings: remote_id_tx_uas_id / _uas_id_type / _ua_type / _operator_id. An empty UAS ID falls back to a
 *     serial derived from this device's own part code, so an unconfigured unit is still a usable test transmitter.
 *
 * Transmit cadence follows ASTM F3411: the dynamic Location/Vector message goes out at >= 1 Hz, while the static
 * identity messages (Basic ID, System, Operator ID) are interleaved at a lower rate. BLE legacy advertising (BT4) can
 * only carry ONE 25-byte ODID message per advertisement, so GetNextLegacyMessage() round-robins the message types with
 * Location in every other slot. BT5 Long Range and WiFi beacons carry a full message pack, built by BuildMessagePack().
