This toolchain file was customized. The original toolchain file is at `${SIMPLELINK_CC13XX_CC26XX_SDK_INSTALL_DIR}/source/cmake/toolchains/gcc.cmake`.

* Newer versions of C++ and C specified (instead of C11 and C++11).
* Changed C++ compiler from gcc to g++ (not sure why this was even a thing, it was breaking hella stuff).
